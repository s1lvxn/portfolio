        Hey, I'm a Junior System Engineer based in Aargau, Switzerland.
        <br /><br />
        I mainly work with networks, servers, and IT infrastructure. Solving technical problems and keeping systems stable is what I enjoy most. <br /><br />    
        I have a passion for scripting with PowerShell, and I'm currently learning Python to explore automation and programming deeper.
        <br /><br />       
        At the moment, I'm also setting up my own homelab to experiment with new technologies and learn more aboute IT infrastructures. <br /><br />    
        This summer, Iâ€™m finishing my Apprenticeship as Platform Developer. (EFZ)<br /><br />
